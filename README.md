Here we provide data and files that were used used for the paper:
["Bayesian inversion for in-situ thermal characterisation of walls in the presence of thermal anomalies"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778824006741)

The code is written to run on a High Performance Computing facilisites. Hence the `.sh` files in `Code` need to be modified accorgingly. We've used Tier 2 Midlands Sulis.

In order to reproduce the results from Section 4, please run

`python main.sh 3D`
